# bus-ticket-reservation
📌 Introduction
The Bus Ticket Reservation System is a mini project in C programming that allows users to book, cancel, and manage bus tickets efficiently. It provides an interactive console-based interface where users can view available buses, reserve seats, check their booking status, and cancel tickets if needed.

This project utilizes file handling to ensure that reservation data is stored and retrieved accurately, making it a simple yet practical system for learning C programming concepts like functions, structures, file operations, and conditional statements.

🎯 Features
✔ View Available Buses – Displays a list of buses with their details (bus number, route, available seats, etc.).
✔ Book Tickets – Allows users to reserve seats by entering passenger details.
✔ Cancel Reservation – Provides an option to cancel previously booked tickets.
✔ Check Booking Status – Displays the details of confirmed reservations.
✔ File Handling – Ensures that bookings remain stored even after the program is closed.

🏗️ Technologies Used
C Programming – Core logic and implementation.
File Handling – To store and retrieve booking details.
